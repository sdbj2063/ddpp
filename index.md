## Why We Care about Students  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) What is significant about Kindergarten - 12th grade (ages 5-18)?  
  
![Washington State Seal](assets/img/wasealsmall.png) The Washington State Constitution says the state has a paramount duty to educate children.   

> "It is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex."  

[Washington Constitution, article IX, section 1](http://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/WM/Documents/2014%20K12%20Citizens%20Guide.pdf)

## The Future  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) I want to learn more. Where do I start?  

![Washington State OSPI](assets/img/waospiseal.png) Visit the [Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](http://www.k12.wa.us). This state office is the custodian of enrollment and financial information for K-12 education.  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) I have ideas on ways to examine the data. How can I help?  

![Email](assets/img/email_icon.png) Email [k12eddata](mailto:k12eddata@gmail.com) with suggestions about data enhancements, such as including funding sources and amounts or a graphical geopolitical interface.
