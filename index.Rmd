## Why We Care about Students  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) What is significant about Kindergarten - 12th grade (ages 5-18)?  
  
![Washington State Seal](assets/img/wasealsmall.png) The Washington State Constitution says the state has a paramount duty to educate children.   

> "It is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex."  

[Washington Constitution, article IX, section 1](http://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/WM/Documents/2014%20K12%20Citizens%20Guide.pdf)

## What we know  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) How many full-time students are there?  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mydata2 <- read.csv("1061_modified_csv.csv", header=TRUE, 
          colClasses = c("character", "integer", "character", rep("numeric", 8)))
mystatestudenttotal <- as.integer(round(sum(mydata2$FTE_students)))
mystatesdcount <- nrow(mydata2)
mystatesdstudentmean <- round(mean(mydata2$FTE_students))
mycountylist <- sort(unique(mydata2$county), decreasing = FALSE)
mycountynumber <- length(mycountylist)
mysummary <- summary(mydata2$FTE_students)
## mynumbers <- sort(mydata2$FTE_students, decreasing = TRUE)
myhighcount <- as.integer(round(mysummary[6], digits = 0))
mylowcount <- as.integer(round(mysummary[1], digits = 0))

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mysummary
```

   
![Student](assets/img/student_freepik.png) In 2012-2013 there were `r mystatestudenttotal` students. They spanned `r mycountynumber` counties and `r mystatesdcount` school districts.  

There was an extreme distribution of students throughout the state. The mean number of students per school district was **`r mystatesdstudentmean`**, but the largest school district had **`r myhighcount`** students, and the smallest school district had **`r mylowcount`** students.

## How this Application Helps  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) What can this application help me understand?  

![Bar Graph](assets/img/devdataprodproject_graphsnip.png) It graphically illustrates the scope of student enrollment throughout the state. You can explore individual school district enrollment by county and compare county figures to statewide figures.

## The Future  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) I want to learn more. Where do I start?  

![Washington State OSPI](assets/img/waospiseal.png) Visit the [Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](http://www.k12.wa.us). This state office is the custodian of enrollment and financial information for K-12 education.  

####  ![?](assets/img/question_mark.png) I have ideas on ways to examine the data. How can I help?  

![Email](assets/img/email_icon.png) Email [k12eddata](mailto:k12eddata@gmail.com) with suggestions about data enhancements, such as including funding sources and amounts or a graphical geopolitical interface.  

##### Thank you for your interest in our children's future!
